//log when raw material moved, save as draft, after production log what parts were made with quantity and how much was wasted log it. log all as inventory movement as, production log is only for final product. it will create two inventory logs for raw material out and parts in with how much wasted as note. or maybe the parts that were manufactured would be in production log too. yeah that sounds better.

//Add createddby createdat updatedby updatedAt attributes for all records taaki multi user support ho

//too tired but need to think about payroll system and calculation
//and stock system. try to avoid to store stock in raw material maybe to avoid duplication. kuch InventoryMovement or dusra stock record bana ke stocks manage karne ka try karne ka hai
