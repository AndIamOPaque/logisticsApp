Logistics Inventory Management

1. Raw Materials & Intake
   - Track new orders for raw materials and whether they have been delivered.
   - Keep record of outsourced parts alongside raw materials.
   - Support subgroups (and nested subgroups).
     Example: Dyed plastics may have interchangeable or non-interchangeable types.

2. Organizing & Categorizing Products
   - Link products to the raw materials they need and the required quantity.
   - When one material is short, show:
     * How many items depend on it
     * How much should be ideally ordered

3. Waste & Repurposing
   - Track clippings and plastic waste that can be remolded.
   - Track other waste to ensure maximum repurposing.

4. Delivery Records
   - Log daily deliveries to customers.
   - Ensure discrepancies are avoided (especially for e-commerce orders).

5. Daily Production
   - Log daily production that will be available for sale next working day.
   - Track incomplete items and their stage of production.

6. Accounts
   - Add new suppliers and buyers.
   - Register bills (ideally via photo upload of physical bill).
   - Preview and review extracted bill information.
   - Auto-flag bills for admin review.
   - Group all bills sensibly (basic intake vs output grouping).

7. Staff Records
   - Attendance:
     * Simple system (e.g., Face ID).
   - Wage Management:
     * Track work done via ID-based weighing of produce per worker.
     * Support wage types: daily, weekly, monthly, or performance-based.
   - Work Distribution:
     * Track available parts/materials for assembly or processing.
     * Distribute work to maximize efficiency.
     * Handle shortages of certain components.

8. Verification & Users
   - Admin:
     * Verify details to avoid missing bills or fraud.
     * Minimize need for admin verification while preventing manager misuse.
   - User/Manager:
     * Enter bills and manage stock data in the app.

9. User Experience
   - Dashboard should show crucial info at a glance:
     * Wasted work hours
     * Raw material shortages
     * Pending orders
     * Status of daily deliveries
   - Ability to:
     * Register new entities (staff, suppliers, buyers).
     * Log production information.
     * Log bills for clearing and incoming payments.

10. Admin Features
    - Review and approve sensitive information before payments.
    - See summary reports:
      * Expected produce for the day
      * Same details as the user dashboard
